### Python gRPC Client to access remote gRPC TensorFlow Server

Protocol Buffer files borrowed from [tobegit3hub/deep_recommend_system](https://github.com/tobegit3hub/deep_recommend_system/tree/master/python_predict_client)

While creating a remote gRPC Client, came across [this issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/issues/237) which didn't have a pure pythonic solution, instead going about through _Bazel_ compilation (Like the one described in TensorFlow Serving inference webpage).
